# Pop Workspace

The [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) playbook that powers my [Pop_OS!](https://pop.system76.com/) computers. Installs all the tools, programming languages and apps that I use and applies my opinionated preferences for the shell, GNOME and other things.

## Things missing

- [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/)
- [ULauncher](https://ulauncher.io/) extensions
- Grub configuration and theming
- GNOME extensions

## To-do

- Do a full cleanup of my shell variables and functions
