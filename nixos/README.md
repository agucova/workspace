# NixOS with GNOME Desktop

A NixOS configuration with a clean, optimized GNOME Desktop environment located in the `nixos/` subdirectory of this repository.

## Quick Setup Guide

Since this is your personal repository with multiple projects, and NixOS configuration lives in the `nixos/` subdirectory:

1. **Clone the repository (if not already done)**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/workspace.git ~/repos/workspace
   cd ~/repos/workspace
   ```

2. **Copy your hardware configuration**:
   ```bash
   sudo cp /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix ~/repos/workspace/nixos/hosts/gnome/
   ```

3. **Apply the configuration**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/repos/workspace/nixos
   sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#gnome-nixos --experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' --impure
   ```
   
   > **Note**: The `--impure` flag is required when your hardware configuration file isn't committed to Git. This allows Nix to use files that aren't tracked in the Git repository.

That's it! Your system will rebuild with the customized GNOME configuration.

## Customization

To modify your NixOS setup:

- System settings: `~/repos/workspace/nixos/hosts/gnome/configuration.nix`
- GNOME-specific settings: `~/repos/workspace/nixos/modules/gnome.nix`

## Updating Your System

```bash
cd ~/repos/workspace/nixos
nix flake update
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#gnome-nixos --experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' --impure
```

## Enabling Flakes Permanently

Add this to your configuration.nix:
```nix
nix.settings.experimental-features = [ "nix-command" "flakes" ];
```

Then rebuild your system.

## Hardware Configuration

### Hardware-Specific Files

The `hardware-configuration.nix` file contains system-specific hardware details and is typically not committed to version control because:

1. It contains machine-specific information (disk UUIDs, partition layouts)
2. It changes when hardware changes
3. It's automatically generated by `nixos-generate-config`

If you're setting up a new system and don't have this file yet, generate it with:

```bash
cd ~/repos/workspace
sudo nixos-generate-config --dir nixos/hosts/gnome
```

When using a flake in a Git repository with uncommitted files (like your hardware configuration), always use the `--impure` flag with nixos-rebuild to allow Nix to see the uncommitted files.

### Hardware Optimizations

This configuration includes optimizations for:

- **NVIDIA RTX 4090** - Proprietary drivers with proper Wayland support
- **AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D** - Performance governor and microcode updates
- **Ultrawide monitors** - Default scaling that works well with 2K/3K ultrawides

## GNOME Features

This configuration includes:
- Clean GNOME desktop with minimal customization
- GNOME Tweaks, dconf-editor, and Shell Extensions
- Ghostty terminal with GPU acceleration
- Flatpak support for additional applications
