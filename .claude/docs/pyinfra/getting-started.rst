Getting Started
===============

This guide should help describe the basics of deploying stuff with pyinfra. Start by installing pyinfra with ``pip`` (see :doc:`full install instructions <./install>`):

.. code:: bash

    pip install pyinfra

To do something with pyinfra you need two things:

:doc:`Inventory <./inventory-data>`:
    Hosts, groups and data. Hosts are targets for pyinfra to execute commands or state changes (server via SSH, container via Docker, etc). Hosts can be assigned to groups, and data can then be assigned to both groups and individual hosts.

:doc:`Operations <./using-operations>`:
    Commands to execute or state to apply to the target hosts in the inventory. These can be simple shell commands *"execute the uptime command"* or state definitions *"ensure the iftop apt package is installed"*.

    State definition operations will not make changes unless required by diff-ing the target state against the state of the operation.

Ad-hoc commands with pyinfra
--------------------------------

You can start pyinfra immediately with some ad-hoc command execution. The CLI always takes arguments in order ``INVENTORY`` then ``OPERATIONS``. You can target a SSH server, Docker container or the local machine for quick testing:

.. code:: shell

    pyinfra INVENTORY OPERATIONS...

    # Execute over SSH
    pyinfra my-server.net exec -- echo "hello world"

    # Execute within a new docker container
    pyinfra @docker/ubuntu:18.04 exec -- echo "hello world"

    # Execute on the local machine (MacOS/Linux only - for now)
    pyinfra @local exec -- echo "hello world"

When you run this pyinfra connects (or spins up a container), runs the echo command and prints the output. The :doc:`CLI page <./cli>` contains more :ref:`examples of ad-hoc commands <cli:Ad-hoc command execution>`.

State definitions
-----------------

Operations can be used to define the desired state of target hosts. pyinfra will then determine what, if any, changes need to be made and apply them. This means that when you run these operations for a second time, pyinfra won't need to do do anything because the target is already up to date.

.. code:: shell

    # Ensure a package is installed on a Centos 8 instance
    pyinfra my-server.net dnf.packages vim

    # Stop a service on a remote host over SSH
    pyinfra my-server.net init.systemd httpd running=False _sudo=True

In this case you can re-run the above commands and the second time pyinfra will report no changes need to be made.

.. admonition:: Note for Docker users
    :class: note

    When using ``@docker/IMAGE`` syntax, pyinfra will use a new container each run (meaning there will always be changes). You can use the image from the first run in the second (``@docker/IMAGEID``) to test the state change handling.

Create a Deploy
---------------

A deploy is a collection of inventories and operations defined in Python files. These deploys can be saved and reused (committed to git, etc). Think of a deploy like Ansible's playbook or Chef's cookbook.

To get started create an ``inventory.py`` containing our hosts to target:

.. code:: python

    # Define a group as a list of hosts
    my_hosts = ["my-server.net", "@docker/ubuntu:18.04"]

Now create a ``deploy.py`` containing our operations to execute:

.. code:: python

    from pyinfra.operations import apt, server

    # Define some state - this operation will do nothing on subsequent runs
    apt.packages(
        name="Ensure the vim apt package is installed",
        packages=["vim"],
        _sudo=True,  # use sudo when installing the packages
    )

This can now be executed like this:

.. code:: shell

    pyinfra inventory.py deploy.py

That's the basics of pyinfra!
